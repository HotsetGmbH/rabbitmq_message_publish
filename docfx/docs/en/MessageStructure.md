# Content and Structure of Messages

## Basics

Messages are structured information in JSON format.

A message should be complete. This means it contains all necessary information for processing. This ensures that consistent data is processed and interface processes do not need to read additional data from the source system to process a message, as this data may have already been changed by now.

All information of a record from the source system should be included in a message. Interfaces can decide which information is needed and which can be ignored.

## Header Information

All messages have a similar structure and contain this metadata in their header:

| Field                      | Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                              |

## Content Structure

The content is the actual message text. It is sent in the data format of the source system (field names and representation of values). Ideally, it is a simple list of fields and their values. However, there may also be nested information, for example, to reference the content of other objects.

Interfaces must interpret this format and process the message in the target system.

## Additional Structures

For debugging purposes or to support interface processes, additional structures may follow the content of a message.

## Example

```json

  "transaction_id": "{D0400FFB-A302-49CF-87DF-8758C165BFF3}",
